# Vending machine app
This is my first application that is based on a vending machine. I used an online template to replicate how a real life vending machine would work. I set up the front end with the vending machine user interface and the back ed with the administrator interface.

The user can choose a drink and buy it for 1 dollar while the administrator can add a new drink and the amount of drink for each selection.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Passport

## Lessons Learned:
With this project we had multiple .ejs files to navigate through so we really got the chance to pull from the database in more complex ways. I also learned how to connect arrays of objects, introduce the contructor method and understood how to increment amount in an objects preperty.

## canceled Installation:

If i had more time, i would have added a delete button for the administrator and a reset button for the money he is making. And lastly, i would have added a way for new list of drinks to be appended to the DOM and the admin adds a new drink to the vending machine row.   

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage

1. run `node server.js`
2. Navigate to `localhost:8080`
